Â
A
Hungarian-born
fencer,
AladÃ¡r
Gerevich
played
an
instrumental
role
in
his
countryâs
dominance
of
Olympic
fencing
for
36
years.Â
Born
in
1910,
Gerevichâs
first
Olympic
appearance
came
in
1932,
where
he
won
gold
at
the
age
of
22
during
the
Los
Angeles
Games
as
a
part
of
Hungaryâs
sabreÂ
team.Â
In
the
1936
Olympics
at
Berlin,
Gerevich
accumulated
17
wins
in
sabre
fencing
and
only
two
losses,
leading
his
team
to
victory.Â
He
also
won
bronze
in
the
individual
sabre
event.Â
Gerevichâs
career
was
briefly
interrupted
when
the
Olympics
were
suspended
during
World
War
II.
However,
after
the
end
of
the
war,
he
returned
with
a
vengeance,
competing
in
the
1948
London
Games
and
winning
gold
in
both
the
team
and
individual
sabre,
accumulating
19
wins
and
only
one
loss
in
individual
sabre.Â
At
the
1952
Helsinki
Games,
Gerevich
continued
his
success
by
winning
one
of
each
type
of
medal:
a
gold
in
team
sabre,
a
silver
in
individual
sabre,
and
a
bronze
in
team
foil.Â
Though
he
placed
fifth
in
the
individual
sabre
in
1956,
he
helped
the
Hungarian
team
win
another
gold
in
team
sabre.Â
Gerevichâs
last
Olympic
appearance
was
at
the
age
of
50,
in
the
1960
Rome
Games.Â
There,
he
earned
a
final
gold
in
team
sabre,
the
sixth
consecutive
gold
for
his
Hungarian
team.Â
Gerevich
holds
the
record
of
being
one
of
only
two
athletes
to
win
six
gold
medals
in
the
same
Olympic
event,
the
other
being
German
equestrian
Isabell
Werth.Â

hailed
from
Italy
and
won
14
Olympic
medals
and
13
team
World
Championships
over
his
40-year
career.Â
Mangiarotti
was
the
son
of
a
master
fencer
and
began
to
learn
lessons
from
his
father
at
the
age
of
eight.Â
Though
he
was
a
natural
right-handed
fencer,
Mangiarottiâs
father
convinced
him
to
train
with
his
left
hand
to
gain
a
competitive
advantage.Â
In
his
first
Olympics,
the
1936
Berlin
Games,
Mangiarotti
was
only
17
years
old,
but
his
efforts
helped
Italy
secure
a
gold
medal
in
the
team
Ã©pÃ©e
event.Â
After
the
war,
Mangiarotti
returned
to
the
Olympics
and
won
three
more
team
golds
in
Ã©pÃ©e
(1952,
1956,
and
1960),
as
well
as
a
silver
in
the
team
Ã©pÃ©e
in
1948.Â
In
the
foil
competition,
Mangiarotti
won
a
team
gold
in
1956
and
three
team
silvers
in
1948,
1952,
and
1960.Â
As
an
individual
fencer,
Mangiarotti
also
excelled,
winning
a
gold
medal
in
the
individual
Ã©pÃ©e
in
1952
and
a
silver
in
the
individual
foil.Â
He
also
won
individual
bronze
medals
in
the
Ã©pÃ©e
in
1948
and
1956.Â
Altogether,
Mangiarottiâs
13
Olympic
medals
are
the
most
Olympic
medals
ever
won
by
a
fencer.Â

throughout
the
1950s,
and

of
the
famed
Hungarian
fencing
team
that
included
Gerevich
and
KÃ¡rpÃ¡ti,
PÃ¡l
KovÃ¡cs
was
a
unique
athlete
in
that
he
began
his
athletic
career
not
as
a
fencer,
but
as
a
hurdler.Â
Though
he
was
promising
as
a
track
and
field
athlete,
KovÃ¡cs
decided
to
switch
to
fencing
and
thereafter
joined
the
Hungarian
fencing
team.Â
As

he
joined
his
squad
in
five
consecutive
Olympic
games,
beginning
in

and
ending
in

in
Rome.Â
At
these
five
Olympics,
KovÃ¡cs
earned
a
total
of
six
gold
medals
and
one
bronze.Â
Five
of
his
golds
came
in

team

event,
while
one,
in
1952,
was
in
the
individual

His
solitary

FederationWorld
War

veteranKnown
as
one
of
the
most
versatile
fencers
in
Olympic
history,
Italian
swordsman
Nedo
Nadi
won
at
least
one
Olympic
gold
with
all
three
of
the
classic
fencing
weapons
(foil,
sabre,
and
Ã©pÃ©e).Â
Nedo
was
trained
in
fencing
from
a
young
age
by
his
father,
and
like
fellow
Italian
Edoardo
Mangiarotti,
Nadi
trained
alongside
his
brother.Â
As
a
child,
Nadiâs
father
forbade
his
sons
from
training
with
the
Ã©pÃ©e,
which
he
considered
an
âundisciplinedâ
weapon,
but
Nedo,
determined
to
master
every
style
of
fencing,
often
snuck
out
to
practice
with
the
Ã©pÃ©e
on
his
own.Â
In
1912,
Nedo
made
his
Olympic
debut
at
the
Stockholm
Games,
winning
the
foil
competition
at
only
18
years
of
age.Â
Eight
years
later,
in
1920,
Nadi
returned
to
the
Olympics
in
Antwerp.Â
There,
he
accomplished
a
stunning
feat,
first
by
helping
the
Italian
team
win
a
team
gold
in
the
foil,
and
then
by
winning
the
gold
medal
in
the
individual
foil
with
22
winning
matches
and
only
two
losses.Â
Nadiâs
disobedience
of
his
fatherâs
rules
as
a
child
paid
off
days
later
when
he
won
gold
in
the
team
Ã©pÃ©e
event.Â
Nadi
capped
off
his
incredible
performance
at
Antwerp
with
two
more
golds
in
the
individual
and
team
sabre
events,
earning
a
record
five
gold
medals
at
a
single
Olympics.Â
Nadiâs
brother,
Aldo,
also
won
medals
at
Antwerp.Â
After
the
1920
games,
Nedo
Nadi
retired
from
fencing
and
taught
the
sport
as
a
professional
in
South
America.Â
Upon
his
return
to
Italy,
he
served
as
president
of
the
Italian
Fencing
Federation
and
also
distinguished
himself
by
fighting
in
World
War
I,
where
he
was
decorated
by
the
Italian
government
for
bravery.Â

Italian
fencer,
Giuseppe
Delfino
first
learned
to
fence
while
working
for
a
Fiat
car
factory
in
Torino,
where
he
had
access
to
the
companyâs
sports
facilities.Â
His
efforts
in
the
sport
quickly
grew
and
in
time
he
became
one
of
Italyâs
top
fencers
in
the
Ã©pÃ©e,
helping
his
country
dominate
that
weapon
in
fencing.Â
Across
his
Olympics

Delfino
was
a
member
of
three
gold-medal
teams,
winning
first-place
medals

up
with
six
World
Championship-winning
teams.
Aside

these
memorable
team
victories,
Delfino
was
also
a
successful
individual
fencer.Â
He
nearly
won
individual
gold
in
1956,
ending
only
a
single
touch
away
from
the
prize
when
he
lost
to
American
Richard
Pew.Â
In
1960,
Delfino
came
to
his
home
country
for
the
Rome
Olympics
and
there
achieved
his
goal
of
winning
gold
by
defeating
British
fencer
Allan
Jay
in
a
tie-break.Â
Delfino
won
a
team
silver
in
the
Ã©pÃ©e
in
1964,
after
which
he
retired
from
fencing
and
became
the
president
of
the
Torino
Fencing
Club
and
later
the
Ivrea
Fencing
Club.Â
After
his
death
in
1999,
the
Ivrea
Fencing
Club
was
renamed
the
âCircolo
Scherma
Giuseppe
Delfinoâ
(âGiuseppe

in
Delfinoâs
honor.Â
